# ðŸ“ˆECOMMERCE LOGISTICS ANALYSIS

## 1. Project Background

### 1.1. Situation

The **e-commerce industry** is experiencing rapid growth, and **delivery efficiency** plays a crucial role in **customer satisfaction** and **competitive advantage**. However, many e-commerce companies face challenges in optimizing their delivery process due to high costs, inconsistent delivery times, and external factors such as geography and weather conditions.

Imagine you are a **data analyst** at an **e-commerce logistics company**. The company is **implementing a strategy to enhance overall delivery service quality**. To achieve this, it must leverage **business data** to identify key issues affecting delivery performance and **develop effective solutions**.

### 1.2. Objective
- **Comprehensively evaluate the companyâ€™s delivery performance.**
- **Analyze the key factors impacting delivery efficiency** and **provide data-driven recommendations** to support future strategic improvements.

## 3. Executive Summary

Overall, the company's delivery performance remains suboptimal, and there has been no significant improvement in overall delivery efficiency over time (see **Figures 1 and 2**). Specifically:

- The number of orders placed in 2023 decreased by **13%** compared to 2022 (**calculated based on the time range from May 1 to December 31 for both years, as full-year data for 2022 is unavailable**).

## 4. Insight Deep-Dive

After an in-depth analysis of the data, we identified **two key issues** behind the company's poor performance and lack of growth: **(1) No strategy to attract new customers**, and **(2) High customer churn** (as shown in **Figure 4**).

<div align="center">

  **Figure 4:** Customer Cohort Analysis for 2022 and 2023

</div>

- **Lack of New Customer Acquisition (Refer to the "New Customer" Column):**
Throughout both 2022 and 2023, the number of new customers acquired declined significantly. Additionally, the 2023 trend shows a much lower new customer acquisition rate compared to 2022.
- **High Customer Churn (Refer to Columns â€˜1â€™ and Beyond):**
The customer retention rate remained low, ranging only from **13% to 21%** across most months. The only exception was during major shopping events in November and December, when retention temporarily increased to **33% to 47%**.
- **Key Reasons for Low Customer Retention:**
Several factors contribute to poor retention, with four critical reasons negatively impacting customer experience and brand loyalty (See **Figure 5**):
  - The delivery process is not optimized
  - Product quality issues
  - Subpar customer service
  - Inability to manage sudden order surges (**2â€“3x normal volume**) effectively (see **Section 4.4** for details).

## 4.1. In-Depth Analysis of the Delivery Process

The delivery process has three main issues causing customer dissatisfaction (see **Figure 6**):
1. **Packaging stage:** Poor packaging quality and unappealing presentation.
2. **Transit stage:** Product damage due to handling between warehouses.
3. **Delivery time:** Slow delivery times negatively impacting the shopping experience.

<div align="center">
  
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ed13d81-3c81-47e5-bb07-c50487d1bdd1)

  **Figure 6:** Customer Negative Feedback

</div>

There is **insufficient data** to analyze **packaging and transit issues** in detail. Therefore, **this section focuses on the reasons behind late deliveries**. Out of **40,077** completed orders, **19,812** were delayed.

**Key Reasons for Delivery Delays:**

1. **Inefficient transit process:** The transfer of products from stores to warehouses near customers takes excessive time, **causing 46% of total late orders**. Specifically:

    - **3,064 orders** were already delayed before reaching the **delivery stage**.
    - **6,039 orders** required shipping **within 24 hours** but were delayed, likely due to operational inefficiencies.

2. **Low delivery efficiency among shippers:** 149 out of 155 shippers handled fewer than two orders per day. The average delivery time per order was **at least 52 hours** (**more than two days**) (see **Figure 7**).

  **Figure 7:** Shipper delivery time distribution for those handling fewer than two orders per day

</div>

3. **The company's delivery operations are inefficient:** Orders with longer delivery time requirements (**high time_required**) are prioritized for early delivery (**very low delivering_time**), while orders with tighter deadlines (**low time_required**) are delayed (**very high delivering_time**). As a result, on-time orders (**n_orders_ontime**) are delivered too early, whereas late orders (**n_orders_late**) experience significant delays. This pattern is clearly illustrated in **Figure 8** below.

### 4.2. In-Depth Analysis of Product Quality

The following product quality issues need to be addressed:
- Poor product appearance
- Products not matching descriptions
- Extremely low product quality

<div align="center">

  **Figure 9:** Customer Negative Feedback

</div>

These issues are most prevalent in the Fashion, Beauty, and Home categories, which are also the company's top revenue-generating product lines. The company must pay close attention to customer feedback to develop better product strategies (see **Figure 10**).

</div> 

### 4.3/. Analysis of Customer Service

While customer service issues account for a small percentage of total orders (around 3.1%), improving this area will enhance the company's overall service quality and create a long-term competitive advantage.

### 4.4/. Analysis of Order Volume Risk Management

The overall efficiency of the delivery process is significantly impacted when order volumes surge **2-3 times** higher than usual.

<div align="center">
  
  ![decrease 13% (6)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a35cd66-4538-4b98-8b67-756e16bdd768)
  
  **Figure 11:** Trends of Key Metrics from May 2022 to December 2023

</div> 

During November, December 2022, and early January 2023, order volumes spiked due to major shopping events. November saw high demand during **"Double-Eleven" Day (11/11)** and **Black Friday sales (see Figure 12)**. In December and January, orders surged in preparation for Lunar New Year.

<div align="center">

  **Figure 12:** Order Volume Fluctuations in November 2022

</div> 

During these **peak periods**, consumer purchasing activity increases sharply. However, the company lacked **strategies and risk management solutions** to handle the demand surges. As a result, nearly all key delivery performance indicators deteriorated significantly.

## 5. Recommendation

### 5.1. Enhancing Delivery Efficiency

Optimizing all stages of the overall delivery process:
- **Packaging Process:** Conduct training sessions for staff to improve both speed and quality in packaging.
- **Transportation Process:** Improve or redesign sorting procedures, optimize delivery routes, and, if necessary, expand the fleet to increase transportation capacity.
- **Last-Mile Delivery:** Prioritize orders with tighter delivery deadlines, optimize order allocation to shippers, train delivery personnel on efficient routes, and implement motivation programs to boost their performance.

### 5.2. Improving Product Quality

Collaborate with stores to identify product issues and support them in enhancing product quality to better align with customer needs and expectations.

### 5.3. Risk Management
- Develop risk management strategies, especially for peak seasons when order volumes surge 2-3 times higher than usual.
- Build a data analytics system to forecast order spikes in advance.
- Implement solutions for temporary staffing to handle short-term order surges efficiently.

### 5.4. Enhancing Customer Service

Although customer service is not a critical issue at present, it will be a key factor in long-term customer retention. The company should proactively consider improvements in this area for future growth.
